## Description ðŸ“–

The goal is to recreate OpenAI's ChatGPT so that it is easier to access. For example, if there's something simple I want to ask ChatGPT, it may be tedious to go to the website and go through the sign-in process. Building this website allows quick access and is useful for getting answers to short questions one might have.   

I deployed the server side using [Render](https://render.com/) and the client side using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
